### My Favorite Movie: *Transformers One*
**Director:** Josh Cooley

### Reasons why it was my favorite movie
- It shows what Optimus Prime and Megatron was before what we know them today
- Takes place in their planet Cybertron
- Coldest scene of the movie was the big three: Shockwave, Soundwave and Starscream clip getting their decepticon logo
- When Megatron says the line "I am Megatron"
